# website scrapers

I helped a fellow student with his website. At KIT University, Bachelor's and Master's theses are presented online. This website is supposed to provide a complete overview of all possible theses. Scrapers are needed to extract the required information from the websites and transform it appropriately for internal processing. I helped him with this. These scrapers are only examples.
